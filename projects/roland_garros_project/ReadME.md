* The JSON data (from RG's Court Vision feature) was saved in early December 2020. 

`modelling`
-----------
* Fit all Bayesian models of interest 
* Obtain Posterior predictions
* Plot model results (eg: compare player-varying intercepts)

`prototypes`
------------


`collect_data`
--------------
* Scrape Roland Garros tracking data
* Scrape AO tracking data

`eda`


`src`
-----
* All code required to fit Bayesian MNL models (fixed + varying intercepts)
