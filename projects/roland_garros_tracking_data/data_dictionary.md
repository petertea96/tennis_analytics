* doubleFault
* secondServePointsWon
* netPoints
* winner
* firstServePointsWon
* convertedBreakPoints
* returnPoints
* aces
* secondServeIn
* firstServeIn
* unforcedError




### To do

* figure out what server and returner coordinates are

### Play - by - play info in `pointsData`

* Current score features

* `pointId`: Point identifier in format of `set`_`game`_`point`_`serve`. Ex: '1_1_6_1' ==> Set 1, Game 1, Point 6, 1st Serve. Lets are not recorded. 
* `set`: set number (ex: 1, 2, 3, ...)
* `setNumber`: Same as `set`
* `game`: Game number. Ex: 1, 2, ...
* `point`: Point number WITHIN game. Ex: 1, 2, 3,...
* `serve`: Serve Number. Ex: 1, 2

* `serverId`: Server ID (int/char)
* `receiverId`': Returner ID 
* `scorerId`: Point Winner ID 
* `court`: Serve court side. Ex: AdCourt


* Serve features

* `ballSpeedFrench`: Serve speed in KMH 
* `ballSpeed`: Same as `ballSpeedFrench`
* `returnSpeedFrench`: I suspect it's serve speed too.
* `returnSpeed`: Same as `returnSpeedFrench`
* `serveType`: Type of Serve. Ex: Flat, Slice, Pronated
* `distanceOutsideCourt`: How much did a ball miss on Fault (Feet)? Why -- because this variable is only informative when we have a faulty serve.
* `distanceOutsideCourtFrench`: How much did a ball miss on Fault (Metres)?

* How point ended features

* `rallyLength`: Length of rally (including serve)
* `pointEndType`: How point ended. Ex: Winner, Double Fault, Ace, Unforced/Forced error.
* `errorType`: Type of Error. Ex: Net, Wide, Long 
* `trappedByNet`: False,
* `strokeType`: Last stroke type of rally
* `hand`: Last shot of rally
`heightAboveNet`: Ball net clearance at last stroke (feet) Ex: '5.01 Feet'. 
* `heightAboveNetFrench`: Net clearance in metres on LAST STROKE. Ex: '1.53 Metre'. This number matches the last `net` z coordinate in `trajectoryData`
* `winnerPlacement`: Ex: 'Cross Court',
* `unforcedErrorPlacement`: If point end type is unforced error, what type waws it? Ex: Net, Wide, Long. Lots are missing...
* `breakPoint`: Boolean. Is current serve point a break point? 
* `breakPointConverted`: Boolean. Was break point converted? 
* `runAroundForeHand`: ???

### Unknowns 
* `id`: 2
* `pointNumber`: 0
* `cruciality`: Boolean
* `spin`:

### To further explore
`returnSpeed`: Speed in KMH. This always matches with the serve speed.
Sometimes serve speed is missing, but we have return speed. Maybe we can use return speed to impute serve speed?

* `returnPlacement`



### Tracking information

trajectoryData: Full tracking data of each stroke, including: hit, peak, net, bounce).

* What is 'erroneousBall' ?


* `serveBounceCordinate`: (x,y,z) Serve Bounce
* `ballHitCordinate`: (x,y,z) Where ball is struck on last legal shot
* `ballBounceCordinate`: (x,y,z) Last ball bounce of rally
* `ballPeakCordinate`:  Last `peak` coordinates in `trajectoryData`
`serverCordinate`:
`receiverCordinate`:
`ballLastCordinate`:
`ballNetCordinate`:
